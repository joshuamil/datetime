# Date and Time Dashboard

This is something I've been using locally for a long, long time and occasionally
I update it to do something else. Very simply put, it's a calendar and a clock
that doesn't look completely awful. I'm currently migrating it to use Webpack,
ES6 and all of the latest JS goodness.
